    <h1 class = "daniel hidden">About Me</h1>
		<h2 class = "uni hidden">My name is Daniel Simms, and i'm a student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. I have always had a passion for Computer Science, taking it for both GCSE and A-Level, scoring high grades in both. My love for software engineering came during my A-Level project, where i learnt<em> HTML, CSS and Javascript,</em> and the skills required to incorporate them to create a website. I have always enjoyed creating things, and being able to see my work come to fruition motivates me to learn more.</h2>
